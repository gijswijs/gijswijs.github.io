# NeumannSSG

This is a neumannssg site. NeuamnnSsg is a static site generator that runs completely in the browser.
You can fork this repo and turn on Github Pages (from the master branch) to have this exact same site hosted as your own.\* Better yet, head over to <https://neumannjs.github.io/admin> and login with your own Github account. It will then lead you through the process of setting up a brand new site in your own Github account, with all the correct settings.

- Don't forget to add a neumannssg topic to your repo after forking. If you go through the wizard, the topic will be added automatically.
