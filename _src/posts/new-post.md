Janos is a static site generator. What makes Janos different is that it is comes with free hosting, using Github Pages, and browser based content management. The only thing you need is a free account at Github and you are up and running in less than 5 minutes.

Janos is built with Javascript and runs completely in the browser.
And it runs Github Pages from the master branch.
