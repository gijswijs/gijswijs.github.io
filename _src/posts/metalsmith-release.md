Janos is a static site generator operating fully in the browser. It uses Metalsmith with a bit of Webpack magic springled on top, to make it all work inside a browser. It is tightly integrated with Github to automaticaly host your site, using Github pages.

Janos is now public and can be used by anybody. It is still far from a 1.0 release, but it is definitely usable. The site you ar reading right now is (obviously) created using Janos.
