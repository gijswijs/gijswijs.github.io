I found this super easy way to animate your slides with reveal.js that works out of the box with Markdown and Pandoc. Here is how to do it.

Last week I had to give a progress presentation about the current state of my PhD, and I can whip those up in no time. I use [Boilerplate Paper](https://github.com/neumannjs/boilerplate-paper) not only for writing my papers, but also for presentations like this.

I write the presentation in Markdown and then convert it to [https://revealjs.com](reveal.js). But sometimes you want something else than the default sliding transition that reveal.js provides. 


Reveal.js got you covered with [auto-animate](https://revealjs.com/auto-animate/)
