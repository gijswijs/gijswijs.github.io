Janos is a static site generator with multiple templates to use. Janos fully operates in the browser. It uses Metalsmith with a bit of Webpack magic sprinkled on top, to make it all work inside a browser. It is tightly integrated with GitHub to automatically host your site, using GitHub pages. If you don't know what all that means, that's ok: You should be able to work with Janos without knowing all the ins and outs of those technologies.

Janos can be used by anybody. It is still far from a 1.0 release, but it is definitely usable. The site you are reading right now is (obviously) created using Janos.

You can start today by going to the [admin](https://neumannjs.github.io/Janos-starter/admin/) of this site, and completing the wizard for creating your own website. The only thing you need is a GitHub account, which you can create for free.

The wizard will create a repository in your GitHub account, and turn on GitHub pages and that's it. Now you have a Janos website yourself with content management that only you can use by going to the GitHub pages url with /admin added behind. Anyone visiting your website can start their own website as well, by going to your /admin. They won't be able to edit your website. The only thing available for them is the wizard so that they can create a Janos website as well.

Janos is the only self-replicating entity for which a R0 above 1 is a good thing.
