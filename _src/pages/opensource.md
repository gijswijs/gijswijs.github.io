## Janos

[Janos](https://neumannjs.github.io/Janos-starter/) is a static site generator that runs entirely in the browser. It uses Metalsmith with a bit of Webpack magic sprinkled on top, to make it all work inside a browser. It is tightly integrated with GitHub to automatically host your site, using GitHub pages. But you don't have to know all those techniques; everybody can work with Janos without knowing all the ins and outs of those technologies.

The site you are currently reading is built with Janos.

You can start your own Janos site by going to the [admin](/admin) of this site, and completing the wizard for creating your own website. The only thing you need is a GitHub account, which you can create for free.

Every Janos site can be a starting point for creating a new Janos site.
