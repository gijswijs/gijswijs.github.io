I just finished my Viva and can now call myself Doctor of Philosophy.

I also just started at Lightning Labs. I'm doing a project, working on their new product called Taproot Assets. I am really enjoying the work so far. It is such a pleasure to work on something that actually is in production on mainnet. Doing security on something tangible is a different game entirely.

Looking forward to the spring. Daylight is getting better already. We survived yet another dark winter.
