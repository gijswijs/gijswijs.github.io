Right now I'm finishing my PhD. This still requires finishing and submitting my last article, and distill the last three years of research in a thesis. I just did my thesis announcement, which means that, weather permitting, I'll do my viva voce in the summer and will receive my degree in November.

We just moved back to Amsterdam from Malaysia. It's good to be back in one of my favorite cities, near friends and family. Adjusting to the Netherlands is tough though. I have a hard time with the cold temperatures and sometimes a general sense of homesickness takes over. It just shows how much Malaysia felt like home and that it will take some time to really feel home again in The Netherlands.

Getting more exercise is way easier now. Malaysia was too hot and too humid to do any sports. If you wanted to do anything you had to do it early, early in the morning before sunrise. And even if you did go out for a run, your heart rate would be way up in no time. I just couldn't get my HR in a decent zone for endurance training. Now, in the cold of the Netherlands, I can go out any time of the day and do some real endurance.

I'm busy learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Apart from that, there is just too much going on in the crypto-scene that deserves my interest. But for now it has to go on the back burner, because I need to turn all my attention to finishing my thesis. I need to curb any tendency to procrastinate in the next few weeks.
