Researcher, developer and business founder in no particular order.

I live in Malaysia. For all intents and purposes you could say I live in the amazing city of Kuala Lumpur, but that would rub the real KLites in the wrong way, since I don't live in the city proper.

Before that I lived in Amsterdam.
